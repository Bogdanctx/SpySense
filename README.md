# Abstract

This study proposes a multi-judge (ensemble) system
for static detection of spyware in Windows executable files.
The system combines six diverse classifiers (Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Random
Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning models (1D and 2D CNNs),
each leveraging different representations of Portable Executable
(PE) files. Experimental results show that the ensemble approach
achieves robust and accurate spyware detection, with XGBoost
attaining up to 97% accuracy and 1D CNNs demonstrating
superior generalization compared to 2D CNNs. The findings
highlight the benefits of multi-representation ensembles for static
malware analysis.
